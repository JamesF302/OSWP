You can use JLCPCB or PCBWay for manufacturing the pcb gerbers.

This project will require basic soldering skills and access to a 3D printer

- 1x Raspberry pi pico (or pico W, if you are using Santroller and want to retain wireless connectivity)
- 2x Kailh BOX Navy switches
- 1x Micro USB cable (ideally 10ft)
- Cable ties for USB routing piece
- 7x #3 x 1/4" machine screws to attach strum switch bracket & USB routing piece to pcb
